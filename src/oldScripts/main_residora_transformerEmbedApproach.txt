"""
    The amino acid sequence is first transformed into a sequence of one-hot encoded vectors, with each vector corresponding to an amino acid.

    The one-hot encoded sequence is then fed through the transformer embedding network, which maps the sequence to a higher-dimensional space where it can be better processed.

    The transformed sequence is then fed into the RL policy network, which outputs a probability distribution over the actions.

    The RL agent takes an action based on the probability distribution, and updates the sequence accordingly.

    The new sequence is then fed back into the transformer embedding network, which maps it to the higher-dimensional space again.

    The reward function is then applied to the transformed sequence, and the RL agent updates its policy based on the observed rewards and actions.
    

In this implementation, the amino acid sequence is first converted to a list of tokens, which are then converted to IDs using the tokenizer. 
The IDs are then fed into the transformer embedding model to generate the embedding vectors. 
The embeddings for each position are extracted and fed into the policy network to generate the action probabilities, 
which are then used to sample an action. The sequence is updated based on the action, and the reward is computed using the reward function. 
The discounted reward is then used to update the policy network using the standard RL loss function.
