"""
Here is an example script that uses Gym to define an environment for amino acid sequence evolution, and trains an RL agent using the REINFORCE algorithm:
in this example we define an environment AminoAcidSequenceEnv that represents the task of evolving an amino acid sequence of a given length. 
The environment has a discrete action space of size 20, which corresponds to the 20 possible amino acids. 
The observation space is a box of shape (seq_length,) that contains the current amino acid sequence. 
The reset() method initializes the environment by generating a random amino acid sequence, 
and the step() method takes an action (i.e., a position in the sequence to mutate) and updates the current sequence accordingly, 
and returns the new sequence, the reward, whether the episode is done, and additional information.

We also define a policy network Policy that takes the current amino acid sequence as input and outputs a probability distribution over the actions. 
The policy is trained using the REINFORCE algorithm, which samples actions from the policy, collects the corresponding rewards and log-probabilities, 
and updates the policy using the gradient of the log-probabilities times the returns.

Finally, we create an instance of the environment AminoAcidSequenceEnv with a sequence length of 10, 
and an instance of the policy network Policy with an input size of 10 (corresponding to the sequence length), 
a hidden size of 32, and an output size of 20 (corresponding to the action space size). We then train the policy using the train() function, 
which takes the policy, environment, number of episodes, discount factor, and learning rate as input.

As for the reward function, the example implementation rewards sequences that have a high content of hydrophobic amino acids. 
This is just an example, and the actual reward function will depend on the specific task and objective of the amino acid sequence evolution.

Note that the implementation above is just a basic example, and may need to be adapted or modified depending on the specific requirements of the task. 
Additionally, other RL algorithms, such as PPO or DDPG, may be more appropriate for more complex or continuous amino acid sequence evolution tasks.
