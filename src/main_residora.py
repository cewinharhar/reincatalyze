The task you described can be tackled using a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach called policy gradient. 
In this approach, we train an agent to learn a policy that maps the input sequence of amino acids to a probability distribution over the characters in the sequence. 
The agent then samples a new sequence of amino acids from this distribution and feeds it into the reward function. 
The agent receives a reward based on the output of the reward function and uses this reward to update its policy.

To implement this approach, we first need to define the reward function and the policy network. 
For simplicity, let's assume that the reward function takes a sequence of amino acids as input and outputs a scalar reward value. 
The policy network takes a sequence of amino acids as input and outputs a probability distribution over the characters in the sequence.

Here's a Python script that implements the policy gradient approach for the task you described:
"""

    # The reward function depends on the characters in the sequence
    # Replace this with your own implementation

    return reward

        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.softmax(self.fc2(x), dim=-1)
        return x

    for episode in range(num_episodes):

        with torch.no_grad():

            for i in range(sequence_length):
                new_char = np.random.choice(list(amino_acids), p=y[i].numpy())

        # Evaluate the reward of the new sequence
        reward = reward_function(new_sequence)
        
        # Compute the loss and update the policy network
        log_probs = torch.log(policy_net(x))
        loss = -torch.sum(log_probs * x) * reward
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
