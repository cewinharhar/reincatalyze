Cliprange:
	ec010: not good, too much exploitation
	ec025: long exploitation not enough exploration, to much focus on V90
	ec035: seems to have learning at the end, distributed exploration
	
	winner: ec035 2nd: ec030

DeepMutSize:
	35M: ended in stable plateau, weak exploration
	150M: nice exploration
	650M: very strong exploitation at V90, but interestingly the predicted amino acids changed which probably due to the bigger model which takes more influence from the surroudning amino acids


LrRange:
	a1, c1: interesting stable baseline between 400 & 600 generation with increased reward. Strong exploitation with weak exploration
	a3, x3: strong exploration with medium exploitation, captured the interactio of resi 90+91 with substrate
	a6, c6: very volatile rewards, good exploration & exploitation, but probably too much learning rate
	a9, c9: interesting due to volatility and exploration & exploitation

nr:Hidden (note ec0.3 & a9, c9)
	128: very volatile with good exploratoin & exploitation, catches D81 which neighbors R81 which is very close to substrate, maybe has effect due to relaxation
	256 (default): seems to learn (compared from cliprange with ec035)
	512: Very volatile rewards with okay exploration & exploitation. I can imagine this could become better!
	1024: after gen 400 model is stuck with D287A but its too far to interact with substrate. Maybe needs longer training
	128_128: best so far, reaches very! stable baseline after gen400 and focuses on exploiting after having explored a 3000 timesteps
	256_256: doesnt seem to learn anything (note: was trained over 1500 generations)

to repeat: clip0.3, 0.4
